                <div class="ui-body ui-body-a">
                    <p>Naloxone is a prescription medicine that temporarily stops the effect of opioids. This helps a person start to breathe again and wake up from an opioid overdose. Naloxone (the generic name) is also known as Narcan.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Only works on opioids; it has no effect on someone who has not taken opioids.</li>
                        <li>Cannot be used to get high and is not addictive.</li>
                        <li>Has a long safety history; adverse side effects are rare.</li>
                        <li>Can be easily and safely administered by anyone.</li>
                        <li>Is legal to carry in the Greater Cincinnati area.</li>

                    <p>Naloxone, also known as Narcan, is a safe and effective medication
                        that can reverse the effects of opioid overdose.
                        It is either injected or administered through a persons nose.
                        It attaches to the same parts of the brain that receive heroin
                        and other opioids, and it blocks the opioids for 30-90 minutes to reverse the respiratory
                        depression that would otherwise lead to death from overdose. </p>

                    <p>The following are signs of an overdose:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Loss of consciousness</li>
                        <li>Unresponsive to outside stimulus</li>
                        <li>Awake, but unable to talk</li>
                        <li>Breathing is very slow and shallow, erratic, or has stopped</li>
                        <li>For lighter skinned people, the skin tone turns bluish purple, for darker skinned people, it turns grayish or ashen.</li>
                        <li>Choking sounds, or a snore-like gurgling noise (sometimes called the “death rattle”)</li>
                        <li>Vomiting</li>
                        <li>Body is very limp</li>
                        <li>Face is very pale or clammy</li>
                        <li>Fingernails and lips turn blue or purplish black</li>
                        <li>Pulse (heartbeat) is slow, erratic, or not there at all</li>
                    </ul>
                    If someone is making unfamiliar sounds while sleeping it is worth trying to wake him or her up. Many loved ones of users think a person was snoring, when in fact the person was overdosing. These situations are a missed opportunity to intervene and save a life.
                    <p>
                        It is rare for someone to die immediately from an overdose.  When people survive, it is because someone was there to respond.

                        The most important thing is to act right away!  Call 911!</p>
